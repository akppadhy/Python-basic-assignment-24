    "#1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. As an expression, lambda returns a value that can optionally be assigned a name. \n",
    "In contrast, the def statement always assigns the new function to the name in the header, instead of returning is as a result. lambda's body is a single expression, not a block of statements"

    "#3. Compare and contrast map, filter, and reduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Map operation takes a mapping function and a vector of data as arguments and returns a new vector, which is the result of applying the mapping function on each element of the vector independently. The returned value from map() (map object) then can be passed to functions like list() (to create a list), set() (to create a set) and so on.\n",

    "#5. What are recursive functions, and how are they used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions. This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself (\"recurse\"). \n",
